# Interactive Atomic Orbital Viewer

A visualizer for atomic orbitals. It shows both the (real) wavefunction, as well as its equation. Uses Plotly.js, Math.js, and KaTeX.
I used the help of Gemini, and hope that the wavefunction equations are correct (They do match according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_spherical_harmonics#Real_spherical_harmonics), just remember sin(θ)*cos(θ) = sin(2θ)/2).
